# Full stack app with React and a REST API

In this project I have created a full-stack application that uses a React client with a REST API that I created in a previous project. This application is in essence a school database with a list of courses at the school. Anyone can access the list of courses at the school but only authenticated users can create courses, and only users who's id matches the course can update and delete that course.

Users can also create a new account, and then create new courses, and update or delete those courses that they've created.
